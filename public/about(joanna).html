<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a passion since high school in computer, That's why I end up taking
  a Computer Engineering Course. I love learning the technology on how it evolve and 
  making life easier</p>

<p>Computer is so fun to learn, We can communicate with anyone on the planet, 
  no matter where they are, with the help of smartphones and social media. 
  Technology is also making our lives easier and more efficient. 
  We can now automate many of our tasks, such as scheduling appointments or 
  managing finances, with the help of computers and software</p>

<p>Career choice and progression doesn’t have to fit into the standard societal mold. Do what you love and want to do. Find what you’re good at, 
   what you can sell or provide that is unique to you and go for it</p>
